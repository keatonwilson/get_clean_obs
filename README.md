# get_clean_obs
A repo housing the custom get_clean_obs function that pulls and cleans inat and 
GBIF observations for a single species and incorpoates geographic bounding boxes.  

Uses the `spocc` package from rOpenSci, but also interfaces with the iNaturalist API
directly (depending on the number of records being pulled).
